**`Endless Learner and Self-Proclaimed Digital Artist (Coding/Blender/Film)`**

I'm a full-stack developer that mainly focuses on the frontend. I know enough on the backend
to be dangerous (helpful) but much prefer to spend my time turning designs into interactive websites. I'm in 
the process of overhauling my GitHub profile as it has suffered from some minor neglect. Please check back to see my updates
and potential projects we can collaborate on. The world of coding creates a digital "outer-space" worth of possibilities,
and together we can reinvent anything and everything.

<summary><h3>My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I started my coding journey in elementary school. One year during summer I enrolled in a camp hosted by the University of Denver.
  At this camp each day was focused on a different topic. The goal of the camp was to expose kids to different career options
  to help spark some creativity. I ended up winning a book on HTML by designing the "best" website that day. I then took a hiatus on coding
  (if I can be bold enough to call it that) until a couple years after graduating from college. I was working at a SAAS business at the time
  in the Customer Service department while waiting for spots to open up in another department. As part of my duties in this role,
  I helped code some very basic forms for clients. This reignited my latent desire to write code. I signed up for a coding bootcamp, once
  again at the University of Denver. This camp last six months and taught the basics of web development. Upon completion of the bootcamp
  I got my first job in the industry and haven't looked back since.
